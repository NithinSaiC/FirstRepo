# My First Repo

## Step 1

 - #### Created the local repo and added Readme.md fie to the repo using command
    - `git init`
 - #### Add all unstracked changes
    - `git add .`
 - #### Commit to save all the changes locally
    - `git commit -m "Commit Message"`
 - #### Push code to remote repo
    - `git push -u origin main`  ("-u" to remember the repos for further commits so that we don't use repo names for pushing commits) ("orgin" - name of local repo and 'main' name of remote repo)
## Git Branching
   - 'git branch` (to check the current brach and branches present)
